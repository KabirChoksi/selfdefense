      <h1>REDUCE</h1>
<p style={stylingproperties}>Hey, you know how we all sort our trash into recycling and regular bins? That's cool, but have you ever thought about what happens to our waste afterward and how it affects nature?<br/>
Recycling is awesome, right? It feels like we're saving the Earth when we do it! But guess what's even cooler? Reducing waste! That means creating less trash in the first place. In Australia, we're running out of places to put our garbage, especially organic waste. We should totally recycle, but we also need to find ways to use less and reuse stuff too.<br/>
It's not that hard! Like, instead of using plastic bottles, you can carry a keep-cup for your coffee, and skip buying bottled water. Small steps, big difference! If everyone pitches in, we can really make our planet happier. Let's do it! üåçüòä</p>
<h2>If you want, just to check if you are being eco-friendly, take this quick test</h2><br/>
